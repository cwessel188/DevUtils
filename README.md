# DevUtils

These are some utils I've created to help with productivity at EG. 

## .zshrc

This file runs whenever you start a Terminal (CLI ot IntelliJ or any other zsh Terminal). It contains
- some useful aliases for git and maven
- enables showing the branch you're on in the terminal like this
```
user@machine directory [git branch] $ 
```
- sets up Artifactory auths
- some other stuff i've had to add over the years

## dockernuke.sh

Sometimes there are too many Docker images on your machine and you need to remove them all with extreme prejudice.

## turnoffmouseaccel.sh

Because mouse aceleration is bad and MacOS hid this setting deep in it's configs.
